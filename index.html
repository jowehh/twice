              JYP Entertainment had scouted Jihyo after she participated in a

              Entertainment as a trainee at the age of eight and trained for ten

              trained with many JYP idols including Wonder Girls' Sunmi and
              Hyerim, Bae Suzy, Jo Kwon, and Nichkhun. Jihyo was set to debut in
              a girl group along with Nayeon, Jeongyeon and Sana, but the
              project was cancelled. Instead, they all joined the reality

              founding members of Twice. She legally changed her name to Jihyo
              before the competition. As one of nine successful participants,
